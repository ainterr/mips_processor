###MIPS Processor

## Description
This single cycle MIPS processor is the final project of EECE2322 - Digital
Logic Design at Northeastern University. We developed this processor from the
ground up, combining an ALU, register file, and data and instruction memory to
form a complete MIPS datapath.

This processor is written in verilog, is completely synthesizable, and includes
a complete testbench for simulation purposes. We also include a makefile for
building and testing using [iverilog](http://iverilog.icarus.com/).
